[GTI Repper Endpoint]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. TIE Reputation Telemetry, Agent GUID (or a list of GUIDs) must be present [Must-Have]
2. TIE Reputation Telemetry must have a flag to differentiate between first call vs refresh call [Must-Have]
3. TIE Detection Telemetry must have ePO and Device Identifier (ePO GUID and Agent GUIDs) [Good-to-Have]
